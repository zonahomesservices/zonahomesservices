# Zona Homes Services LLC - website

Multi-page site built with [Astro](https://astro.build) (static output), hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
Build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`, Node 22 (`.node-version`).

Production domain: https://zonahomesservices.com/

## Pages (18)
`/`, `/services/`, `/services/<slug>/` x6, `/property-managers/`, `/areas/`, `/areas/<city>/` x5 (Sebring, Avon Park, Lake Placid, Davenport, Sarasota), `/contact/`, `/privacy/`, 404.

## Where things live
- `src/data/services.ts` - copy for each service page (intro, what's included, process, tips, FAQs)
- `src/data/cities.ts` - copy for each city page
- `src/data/site.ts` - phone, URL, Web3Forms key, list of towns and distance tiers
- `src/components/` - header, footer, quote form, FAQ, service-area map
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - SEO tags, Open Graph, canonical, JSON-LD
- `src/styles/global.css` - all styling. Palette (green and cream, from the client's mockup) is in `:root` at the top; dark green bands are the header, property-managers band, final CTA and footer
- `public/` - favicons, fonts, `_headers` (cache and security headers for Cloudflare). The share image is `zona-og-cover` on Cloudinary

## SEO
Unique title, description, canonical and Open Graph on every page; LocalBusiness (HousePainter), Service,
FAQPage and BreadcrumbList structured data; sitemap at `/sitemap-index.xml` (generated at build);
clean URLs with trailing slashes; internal links between services, cities and the property-manager page.

## Logo
`public/assets/logo-light.png` is the light logo (house + wave icon from Gemini with the ZONA / HOMES SERVICES text) for the dark green header and footer. Favicons are in `public/` (`favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-512.png`). The old gold and charcoal logo stays on Cloudinary as `zona-logo-gold-charcoal` but is no longer used.

## Images
Photos load from Cloudinary (cloud name `jrdzspyk`, set in `src/data/site.ts` and the final CTA background in `global.css`) by public ID, no folders in the URLs. Originals are untouched; the site asks for
responsive sizes (`f_auto,q_auto:best,w_N`). Current photos are AI-generated stand-ins: replace with real job photos.

## Quote form
Web3Forms, key in `src/data/site.ts`. Leads go to the email the key was created with.

## Search engines (currently blocked)
While testing, every page has `noindex, nofollow` and `robots.txt` disallows everything. To launch, set `indexable: true`
in `src/data/site.ts` and redeploy: that removes the noindex tag and publishes the sitemap line in `robots.txt`.

## Custom domain
When the real domain is connected, change `site` in `astro.config.mjs`, `url` in `src/data/site.ts`
(`robots.txt` is generated from it).

## Commands
`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`

## Hosting (Cloudflare Pages)
- Project connected to the GitHub repo; every push to `main` deploys, other branches get preview URLs.
- Settings: framework preset Astro, build command `npm run build`, output `dist`, env var `NODE_VERSION=22` if the build asks for it.
- Custom domains: `zonahomesservices.com` and `www.zonahomesservices.com` (DNS on Cloudflare); redirect www to the apex.
- Headers live in `public/_headers`. There is no `vercel.json` anymore.
- The site stays `noindex` until `indexable: true` in `src/data/site.ts`.
